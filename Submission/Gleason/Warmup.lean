# Gleason's theorem, finite-dimensional: the two "warmup" theorems on `[0, 1]`

**Category:** 1-Mathlib (CSD-free; staged for upstream). `specs/gleason-feasibility.md`, stage
57(a), second half: Cooke–Keane–Moran §3 — the one-dimensional "abelianised" versions of
Gleason's theorem, which the core lemma's proof (§5) applies along the latitudes of the sphere.

* **Warmup Theorem I** (`affine_of_sum_eq_const`): a bounded `f : [0, 1] → ℝ` with
  `f a + f b + f c` constant whenever `a + b + c = 1` is affine, `f a = (w − 3 f 0) a + f 0`.
  The engine is `linear_of_add_on_Icc`: an additive function on `[0, 1]` that is bounded there is
  linear — additivity is extended to `ℝ` by `x ↦ g (fract x) + ⌊x⌋ g 1` and
  `Gleason.additive_bounded_linear` (Cauchy's equation with a local bound) finishes.
* **Warmup Theorem II** (`eq_self_of_monotone_sum_eq_one`): let `C ⊆ (0, 1)` be countable and
  `f` be defined off `C` with `f 0 = 0`, monotone on `[0, 1] \ C`, and `f a + f b + f c = 1`
  whenever `a + b + c = 1` off `C`. Then `f a = a` off `C`. The proof picks `a₀ ∈ (0, 1)` outside
  the countable set of rational multiples of `C` and `1 − C`, so that every rational multiple
  `r a₀` and its complement `1 − r a₀` avoid `C`; additivity on those gives `f (r a₀) = r f a₀`,
  monotonicity squeezes every other point between rational multiples, and the frame identity at
  one triple pins the slope to `1`.
