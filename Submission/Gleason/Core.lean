# Gleason's theorem, finite-dimensional: the core lemma discharged, the theorem proved

**Category:** 1-Mathlib (CSD-free; staged for upstream). The end of the staged plan of
`specs/gleason-feasibility.md` (BACKLOG #57): `Gleason/General.lean` proved the core lemma
(`frameFunction_regular_sphere`, stage 57(e)) and `Gleason/Reduction.lean` proved the theorem
from it. This file joins the two.

* `coreLemma` — the core lemma in the form `Reduction.lean` consumes: `CoreLemma` holds.
* ★★ `ProjectionPackage.gleason_representation` — **Gleason's theorem for `ℂᴺ`, `N ≥ 3`:** for
  every projection package `OP` there is a unique density matrix `ρ` with `OP.p P = Re Tr(ρ P)`
  for every orthogonal projection `P`. No hypothesis beyond `N ≥ 3`; `#print axioms` reports the
  foundational triple (pinned in `Tests/AxiomAudit/MathlibStaging.lean`).

What is and is not claimed. This is the finite-dimensional theorem (`ℂᴺ`, `N ≥ 3`) for
probability assignments on orthogonal projections. The infinite-dimensional theorem,
dimension `2` (where the statement fails) and the POVM generalisation (Busch's,
`LF2/EffectGleason.lean`, proved
separately) are outside it. Neither of the two theorems is derived from the other: the proofs
share the Jordan–von Neumann engine (`Gleason/Polarization.lean`) and the descent
(`Gleason/Descent.lean`), nothing else.
