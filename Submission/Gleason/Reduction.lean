# Gleason's theorem, finite-dimensional: the reduction to the core lemma on `S²`

**Category:** 1-Mathlib (CSD-free; staged for upstream). The assembly of
`specs/gleason-feasibility.md`: Layers A and C proved in this tree reduce Gleason's theorem for
`ℂᴺ`, `N ≥ 3`, to one statement about the real sphere `S² ⊂ ℝ³`. That statement is proved in
`Gleason/General.lean` (stage 57(e)); `Gleason/Core.lean` joins the two into the theorem.

* `CoreLemma` — **Gleason's core lemma, as a proposition:** every nonnegative frame function on
  `S²` is the restriction of a symmetric quadratic form. Gleason proved it with spherical
  harmonics (1957, §2); Cooke–Keane–Moran (1985) and Richman–Bridges (1999) proved it with
  elementary geometry of great circles. It is not proved in this file: the elementary proof is
  `Gleason/Sphere.lean` through `Gleason/General.lean` (`frameFunction_regular_sphere`), and
  `Gleason/Core.lean` supplies it here as `coreLemma`.
* ★★ `ProjectionPackage.gleason_representation_of_core` — **Gleason's theorem from the core
  lemma:** for `N ≥ 3`, every projection package on `ℂᴺ` is `P ↦ Re Tr(ρ P)` for a unique density
  matrix `ρ`. The chain: A2 restricts the frame function to every completely real `3`-space
  (`isFrameFunction_realRestrict`); the core lemma makes each restriction a quadratic form;
  `isRealPlaneRegular_of_triples` transports that to every completely real plane; A3
  (`exists_isHermitian_of_isRealPlaneRegular`) produces the Hermitian matrix; Layer C
  (`existsUnique_density_of_frame_quadratic`) makes it the unique density matrix.

This file on its own claims nothing: the theorem's only hypothesis beyond `N ≥ 3` is `CoreLemma`,
stated as a proposition so that the dependency is visible in the statement itself. The
unconditional theorem is `ProjectionPackage.gleason_representation` in `Gleason/Core.lean`.

sphere of `ℝ³` is the restriction of a symmetric quadratic form: for `f` with
`∑ᵢ f (bᵢ) = W` over every orthonormal basis and `f ≥ 0` on the sphere, there is a symmetric
`A` with `f x = x ⬝ᵥ A x` for every unit `x`. -/
